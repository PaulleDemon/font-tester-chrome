Finding it difficult to choose the right font? 
Now test 1000+ free google font types on your website.

Font's adds personality to your website, a sans font on a page gives a different impression
of the page than a mono font. But picking the right one can be hard and time consuming. This is
one of the reason I created Font Tester. 

Now you can go to your website, click on the extension, test fonts and pick the one you like along with the code.

## How to use Font Tester?

In the future we may wrap an element around the selection, based on the user feedback.

### Follow for updates and open-source

* [Github](https://github.com/PaulleDemon)


### Tech stack
* Reactjs
* Tailwind css


### Running it locally

The `manifest.json` required for extension is located inside the public folder.

To load the extension locally. Go to extension -> Load unpacked -> point to dist folder (the build folder).

For development use
```
npm run build:dev
```
This is because the extension requires to point to the build folder, using this command you
won't have to rebuild on every save.

For development you can also use 
`npm start`, but you won't be able to load it as extension but as a react app.

Some important notes:
* The extension attaches to a [shadowdom](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_shadow_DOM), this is to avoid page style affecting the widget style.
